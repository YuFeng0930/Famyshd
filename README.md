### Are you FAMYSHD? Not me!

About 30% of food produced is wasted globally. In Singapore, a whopping 744,000 tonnes of food waste is generated on a yearly basis.
Household food wastage is always a prevalent issue in Singapore; most are generated from leftovers and food that are spoiled or expired. 
Famyshd is a Telegram Bot which aims to reduce food waste, where people can easily share food instead of disposing of them. 


People only need to </br>
Step 1: Access the bot on Telegram (@Famyshd) </br>
Step 2: Add the location, type of food, and a picture of the food theyâ€™re sharing

The bot will then send this message directly to the Channel anonymously.
If other users want the food, they can go to the station, grab the food, and update the status of the food via the bot as well. 
In essence, it's a simple and efficient way for people to share food anonymously.
